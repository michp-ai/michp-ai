- 👋 Hi, I’m @michp-ai
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science especially Machine Learning. I've worked as a Data Scientist and a Data Science Lead. I have a background in Financial Services but more recently worked at a tech startup.
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing up a Masters in Applied Data Science. It has been python-based covering a broad range of techniques and how they can be used to solve real world problems in real-world settings. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - may update this in future but right now I am focused on finishing up my Masters so not currently looking for collaboration.
- 📫 How to reach me emailmjp76-ai@yahoo.com
